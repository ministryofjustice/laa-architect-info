{"prompt":" How many software systems does LAA digital have","completion":" LAA digital is responsible for around 90 software systems; the exact number depends on how you define a software system. The number of systems has increased year on year as LAA digital teams:\n- a) uncover 'shadow' or 'unsupported' systems that are still needed but are not managed or owned by any team\n- b) replace large monolithic software with micro-services\n- c) struggle to decommission older systems\n\n"}
{"prompt":" Why does LAA digital have so many software systems","completion":" LAA digital has steadily accumulated software over the past 25 years. Some possible reasons for this are:\n- a) The natural tendency for organisations to accumulate software as more of their processes are digitised\n- b) The variousness of legal aid. There isn’t a single legal aid journey, there are a number of fundamentally different ones (civil, criminal, legal advice, representation in court). Each one represents a different process with its own language, rules and context for users. Generally speaking, we have found that an entirely different set of services are needed for each legal aid journey type.\n- c) The complexity of legal aid. From a software perspective, we find lots of business logic that is unique to legal aid. This impacts the size of our technical estate because our services tend to require lots of different component capabilities, which are - often appropriately - run as separate software applications.\n- d) The need to 'dual run' new micro-services with older monolithic systems until they are fully replaced\n- e) The need for 'transitional architecture' as we modernise and replace our legacy systems, such as additional APIs and adaptors for integrating new services with those systems\n- f) The MVP Trap. When replacing systems, digital teams are keen to release value quickly and get users into the feedback loop (rightly so!). To do this, they tend to focus MVP scope on high-value, low-effort areas. The ‘trap’ is that once you’ve done the highest-value lowest-effort parts, you are - by definition - left with a tail of lower-value higher-effort ones. It’s very easy for that tail to then get de-prioritised in favour of other, newer business priorities, leaving the old system never fully replaced.\n\n"}
{"prompt":" What kind of software does LAA digital have","completion":" LAA digital has software that supports over a million legal aid applications and over £2 billion in legal aid payments every year, giving those who need it access to justice.\n\nLAA digital has a range of software types including online application forms, eligibility calculators, caseworking systems, and payment systems. The nature and condition of these systems varies a lot - a key factor is whether the system was built before or after LAA digital was created in 2016:\n\n- From around 2000 to 2016, the LAA built systems and digitised a whole raft of paper-based processes using Oracle  products like EBS, Oracle Database, and APEX. As a result, Oracle now powers most of the LAA digital’s biggest systems - CCMS, CWA, CCR, CCLF, MAAT, MLRA, OAS, ERIC, CIS, PIMS, TV, IFS, etc. Legal aid wouldn’t happen without these systems and the teams that look after them -  together they support over a million legal aid applications and over £2 billion in payments every year, giving people who need it access to justice. However, these systems are also problematic: they are fragile and hard to change, and the knowledge they require is increasingly difficult to find and retain. With significant changes to legal aid policy on the horizon (such as the Means Test Review, CLAIR, etc), the struggle to keep these systems operational isn’t getting any easier.\n\n- LAA digital was formed in 2016 as part of a GDS-led movement to bring modern digital approaches into government. LAA digital created a number of autonomous cross-functional product teams to build new services in line with the UK digital service standard. LAA digital shifted towards favouring open source technologies, in particular Ruby, Python and Java.\n\n"}
{"prompt":" What is the strategy of LAA digital","completion":" The strategy for LAA digital is reflected in the Ministry of Justice Digital strategy for 2022 to 2025 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ministry-of-justice-digital-strategy-2025.\n\n"}
{"prompt":" What is the future of LAA digital systems","completion":" - LAA digital will continue trying to reduce the LAA's dependency on systems that meet the government definition of 'legacy' https://www.gov.uk/guidance/managing-legacy-technology.\n- The process of legacy transformation will continue through a mix of 'replacement' and 'modernisation' of LAA digital's older systems.\n- LAA digital will continue favouring an iterative approach to replacement - picking off capabilities from legacy systems one-by-one rather than replacing whole systems as a big bang. This method has the advantage of enabling teams to release value quicker and get users into the feedback loop as early as possible. It does however mean lots of ‘dual running’.\n- LAA digital has entered a ‘transitional state’, during which its technical estate will grow significantly before it can be streamlined back down. This is because LAA digital's biggest legacy systems were not designed in a way that allows specific components to be isolated and turned off as new services come along. New services will need to dual run with older systems until enough capabilities have been replaced to turn the older systems off. This enlarged state will likely last for at least 10 years.\n- During this period, many legacy systems will continue to be critical to the functioning of legal aid and will need to be appropriately modernised so that they remain operational, secure, and updated in line with legal aid policy changes. This modernisation process will continue to be challenging for LAA digital teams because the commercial products behind these systems were customised so much that they no longer resemble ‘off-the-shelf’ products but instead are unique LAA applications, often pinned to old versions of the underlying software.\n- To achieve the goal of creating 'simplified and more reliable access to legal aid services', LAA digital will need to design resilient and adaptable services, and make sure that systems surface the right data to help drive decisions around simplification and automation.\n\n"}
{"prompt":" What programming languages are used by LAA digital teams","completion":" Whilst encouraging alignment, LAA digital prefers to give teams the autonomy to make the software choices that best fit their context rather than mandating a technology stack.

{"prompt":" What is the future of MAAT","completion":" MAAT is a 'legacy' application that is undergoing a modernisation programme. In order to safely implement upcoming changes to legal aid policy, the Crime Modernisation team decided to remove core capabilities from MAAT and 'lift and shift' them into new micro-services that will be easier and safer to implement changes in. The first of these capabilities is the 'Crime Means Assessment' service, which is now built and live - this means that MAAT no longer performs means calculations itself, but instead calls out to the new service. More functional capabilities are being pulled out of MAAT and into new services. At first, these new capabilities will use the MAAT database to persist data (this is because many downstream processes still rely on the data existing in the MAAT database). A future phase of the modernisation process will be to move this data out of the MAAT database and ensure that all relevant integrations are updated. Eventually, the MAAT UI might also be replaced by the new Crime Review service, and LAA digital might be in a position to sunset or decommission MAAT.\n"}

{"prompt":" What is NoLASA","completion":" NoLASA is a software system used to auto-search the Libra system for court case data.\n\n"}
{"prompt":" What is the background context for NoLASA","completion":" The Managed Libra records application (MLRA) is an LAA system that shares a database with the means assessment administration tool (MAAT). It links cases to their corresponding cases in the HMCTS Libra system. This is for the purposes of tracking cases through the course / Legal Aid system in a joined up way (i.e. updates of a person's status through the courts system is updated in LAA systems once a case is linked).\n\nIf an LAA caseworker searches for a case on the Libra system using MLRA and they are unable to find a corresponding case (this can happen for numerous reasons, for instance a Legal Aid application being submitted by a legal provider before the police/courts have added onto LIBRA), the case is marked by a caseworker as 'NOT ON LIBRA' and places onto a backlog queue (the 'not on libra' queue). Case workers will then research these cases at a later date to see if the corresponding case is now on Libra system.\n\nThis researching can take time as there is not a great way of prioritizing cases that may be on Libra. This is where the Nolasa application comes in.\n\n"}
{"prompt":" How does NoLASA work","completion":" Not On Libra Auto-Search Application (NOLASA) is a micro-service that reads cases that have been marked as 'not-on-libra' from the MLRA database once a day (8pm). It then auto-searches the HMCTS Libra system via the LAA's Infox message broker service. The message protocol used is SOAP.\n\nIf NOLASA finds that there are results returned for a case it updates its status in MLRA to say 'RESULTS FOUND'. This means that caseworkers can filter 'not on libra' cases to ones that they know they will have results for. They can then prioritize their case searching and linking more effectively.\n\n"}
