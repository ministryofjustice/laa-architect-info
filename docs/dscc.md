### What is DSCC?
DSCC, also known as the Defence Solicitor Contact Centre, is the means by which the Legal Aid Agency ensures free legal advice is made accessible to a detainee in the police station.

Currently if you are arrested and would like legal advice, a custody officer will call the DSCC and they will assign your case to either your own solicitor or a local on call duty solicitor.

The DSCC will then contact the solicitor and arrange for them to attend to the detainee, either at the police station or remotely.

A Duty Solicitor rota contains information about which solicitors provide this service in different regions of the UK.

Get Legal Advice in Custody (GLAC) is a project in the LAA looking at how the defence solicitor service is delivered.

### Who looks after DSCC?
Currently this service is run entirely by a 3rd party, HGS.

### Who are the users for DSCC?
