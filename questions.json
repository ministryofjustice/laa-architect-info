{"0":" Who are LAA Digital's internal users?\nInternal users of LAA Digital systems include staff from the Legal Aid Agency who process and manage the legal aid fund:\n- Caseworkers who assess applications and claims for legal aid\n- Supervisors who manage caseworkers\n- The assurance team who audit the 'error rate' of legal aid\n- The contracts team who manage contracts with law firms and manage access to legal aid systems\n\n","1":" Who are LAA Digital's external users?\nExternal users of LAA Digital systems include:\n- Legal aid providers (solicitors and those who work for law firms) who apply and claim for legal aid on behalf of clients\n- Members of the public who search for legal providers and submit information when applying for legal aid\n\n","2":" How do LAA Digital systems authenticate users?\nCurrently most LAA Digital services use the [LAA Portal](/docs/laa-portal) to authenticate both internal and externals users. However, some systems have implemented their own identity solutions instead. Going forward, new services are encouraged to use LAA Portal for authenticating external users and use the MOJ AzureAd instance for authenticating internal users.\n\n","3":" Why use LAA Portal for external users?\n- LAA Portal provides a unified front door to LAA services for providers.\n- LAA Portal syncs user data from CWA which provides user management capabilities. This means that systems do not need to take responsibility for handling JML process (joiners, movers, leavers) themselves.\n- LAA Portal is managed by the PCUAM team. Contact PCUAM for more details or for onboarding new services.\n\n","4":" Why use MOJ AzureAD for internal users\nThe MOJ AzureAD instance is used to authenticate DOM1 login. This means that systems can provide a single-sign-on experience for internal users, who only need to login to DOM1 and then can be automatically authenticated with LAA systems. MOJ AzureAD is managed by the MOJ Tech Services team. Contact the TS Demand team to request onboarding of new services to MOJ Azure AD.  \n\n","5":" What authorisation, user management and access control options are there for LAA Digital systems?\nIf using LAA Portal, users and roles are managed via a system called CWA. Systems that do not integrate with LAA Portal need to ensure that appropriate processes are in place for the management of users and user roles, including JML.\n\nEach service is responsible for authorising what users can and cannot do on the service. This means providing appropriate access controls based on the role of the user, together with auditing, logging and security controls. For more guidance on access control and logging, please refer to the [MOJ security guidance](https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/#access-control)\n","6":" What is Benefit Checker?\nBenefit Checker is a software system that retrieves the benefits status of UK citizens from DWP.\n\n","7":" What relationships does Benefit Checker have to other software systems?\n- Benefit Checker calls to DWP API via a SOAP interface to retrieve benefits data\n- eForms calls to Benefit Checker to request benefit status for crimninal legal aid applicants\n- MAAT calls to Benefit Checker to request benefit status for criminal legal aid applicants\n- CCMS calls to Benefit Checker to request benefit status for civil legal aid applicants\n- Crime Apply calls to Benefit Checker to request benefit status for criminal legal aid applicants\n- Civil Apply calls to Benefit Checker to request benefit status for civil legal aid applicants\n- HMPPS, Help With Prison Visits calls to Benefit Checker to request benefit status for prison visitors\n- HMCTS calls to Benefit Checker to request benefit status for court users\n- Scottish Legal Aid Board calls to Benefit Checker to request benefit status for Scottish legal aid applicants\n\n","8":" Where is Benefit Checker hosted?\nBenefit Checker is hosted in the LAA Landing Zone, which uses the AWS London region.\n\n","9":" Who looks after Benefit Checker?\nBenefit Checker is maintained by the Crime Core team in LAA Digital.\n\n","10":" What type of software is Benefit Checker?\nBenefit Checker is an adaptor service that connects to the DWP API. Benefit Checker acts as an interface between the Legal Aid Agency (MOJ) and the Department of Work & Pensions (DWP) + other 3rd parties, providing access to the latest pass-ported benefit entitlement checks including ‘Universal Credit’ status, based on Department of Work and Pensions systems. Benefit Checker is a Java application that uses Tomee. It runs on Java 8. Benefit Checker does not persist data but acts a a wrapper passing on the data it received from DWP to its consumers.\n\n","11":" Who are the users of Benefit Checker?\nBenefit Checker is consumed by other software systems.\n\n","12":" How old is Benefit Checker?\nBenefit Checker was created in around 2014.\n\n","13":" What is the future of Benefit Checker?\nLAA digital is planning to build a new version of the Benefit Checker that will enable the retrieval of updated benefits and income data. These changes will help to support Means Test Review policy changes. Discussions with DWP to support this change are underway.\n","14":" What is Common Platform?\nCommon Platform is a case management system for crown and magistrates court cases.\n\n","15":" What relationships does Common Platform have to LAA digital systems?\n- Court Data Adaptor calls to the Common Platform to request court data and to send legal aid status updates.\n- Common Platform calls to Court Data Adaptor to send court case updates.\n\n","16":" Who looks after Common Platform?\nCommon Platform is run and maintained by HMCTS.\n\n","17":" What is the future of Common Platform?\nCommon Platform is the replacement to the Libra and Xhibit systems. HMCTS are currently rolling out Common Platform to more UK courts.\n","18":" What is the Court Data Adaptor service?\nCourt Data Adaptor (also known as CDA) is a software service used to connect LAA systems to the Common Platform run by HMCTS.\n\n","19":" What relationships does Court Data Adaptor have to other software systems?\n- Court Data Adaptor calls to the Common Platform to request court data and to send legal aid status updates.\n- Common Platform calls to Court Data Adaptor to send court case updates.\n- MAAT API transfers data to Court Data Adaptor via SQS to send legal aid status updates to Common Platform.\n- Court Data Adaptor transfers data to MAAT API via SQS to send court cause updates from Common Platform.\n- View Court Data calls to Court Data Adaptor to retrieve court case data.\n\n","20":" Where is Court Data Adaptor hosted?\nCourt Data Adaptor is hosted in the MOJ Cloud Platform, which uses the AWS London region.\n\n","21":" Who looks after Court Data Adaptor?\nCourt Data Adaptor is maintained by the Crime Core team in LAA Digital.\n\n","22":" What type of software is Court Data Adaptor?\nCourt Data Adaptor is an adaptor that provides an interface to HMCTS data in the Common Platform. Court Data Adaptor has bi-directional data flows with the Common Platform, sending and receiving data and requests. The main function of Court Data Adaptor is data translation, and queueing of requests. Court Data Adaptor is a Ruby on Rails application that uses a Postgres database.\n\n","23":" Who are the users of Court Data Adaptor?\nCourt Data Adaptor is only consumed by other software systems.\n\n","24":" How old is Court Data Adaptor?\nCourt Data Adaptor was created in 2019.\n\n","25":" What is the future of Court Data Adaptor?\nCourt Data Adaptor will continue to provide an interface into court data for LAA systems. As HMCTS continues to roll out Common Platform across more UK courts, the volume of requests and data going through Court Data Adaptor will increase.\n","26":" What is Crime Means Assessment service?\nCrime Means Assessment (also known as CMA) is a software service that performs means assessments for criminal legal aid. Crime Means Assessment can be used to create, update, or retrieve means assessment results.\n\n","27":" What relationships does Crime Means Assessment have to other software systems?\n- Crime Means Assessment calls to the MAAT API to save means assessments to the MAAT database.\n- MAAT calls to the Crime Means Assessment service to request financial eligibility calculations.\n\n","28":" Where is Crime Means Assessment hosted?\nCrime Means Assessment is hosted in the MOJ Cloud Platform, which uses the AWS London region.\n\n","29":" Who looks after Crime Means Assessment?\nCrime Means Assessment is maintained by the Crime Modernisation team in LAA Digital.\n\n","30":" What type of software is Crime Means Assessment?\nCrime Means Assessment is an eligibility calculator that takes information about a criminal legal aid applicant and assesses whether they are financially eligible for legal aid. Crime Means Assessment is a Java based Spring Boot application and uses a Postgres database. Crime Means Assessment can be considered a micro-service that encapsulates crime means assessment.\n\n","31":" Who are the users of Crime Means Assessment?\nCrime Means Assessment is used by the MAAT system.\n\n","32":" How old is Crime Means Assessment?\nCrime Means Assessment was created in 2022.\n\n","33":" What is the future of Crime Means Assessment?\nCrime Means Assessment was developed as part of the MAAT modernisation programme. It replaces the capability in MAAT for assessing the financial eligibility of legal aid applicants. In future a decision will need to be made about who manages the Crime Means Assessment service. Currently it is maintained by the Crime Modernisation team but this responsibility might move to the Eligibility Platform team. Crime Means Assessment might also be refactored to more closely align to the patterns used by other LAA digital eligibility calculators.\n","34":" What are software domains?\nDomains define specific bounded areas of related functionality and data. Domain-driven-design (DDD) is an approach to software development that focuses on developing a rich understanding of the processes, language, and rules of a domain. DDD is particularly suited to complex business domains.\n\n","35":" What software domains does LAA digital have?\nLAA digital has domain boundaries around the different types of law (criminal, civil) and the different phases of the legal journey (custody, advice on legal matters, representation in court).\n\nStrong differences exist between these domains - each has its own language, rules and context for users. This helps us to draw appropriate boundaries around the scope of LAA Digital software applications.\n\nAt a high-level, Criminal legal aid domains include:\n- Advice in custody\n- Representation in a criminal court\n  - Magistrates (crime lower)\n  - Crown (crime higher)\n\nAt a high-level, Civil legal aid domains include:\n- Civil legal help & advice\n- Representation in a civil court\n\nThere are also domains that cut across both civil and criminal:\n- Legal aid providers\n- Eligibility for legal aid\n- Payments\n- Generic domains:\n  - Identity and user management\n  - Data & reporting\n\n","36":" Why is DDD a good fit for LAA Digital teams?\nDDD is designed for complex domains that have lots of business logic. The legal system is complex with many different phases and scenarios, and there are a large number of rules around determining eligibility for legal aid in each scenario. As such, LAA Digital domains tend to be complex, making DDD a useful approach.\n\n","37":" What can LAA Digital teams do to manage complexity?\nOn a day to day basis, teams should think about:\n- Onboarding (because there is a large on-ramp and lots to learn in order to be effective)\n- Knowledge capture (documentation, automated tests, training materials etc)\n- Retention and wellbeing\n- The principles of domain-driven design\n\nTeams should treat these things as first-class priorities and expect to spend more time on them than normal, even if it means slowing down on other priorities in the short-term.\n\nIn terms of planning and strategy:\n- When building new services, think beyond the horizons of the initial MVP - which components of older systems might we be able to turn off, how might the transition be handled\n- When prioritising, see decommissioning as a high-value achievement in its own right and a cause for celebration.\n- Look for opportunities to buy instead of build (to limit the code we own) but avoiding the Fake COTS trap (buying but then needing to heavily customise)\n- Look for opportunities to reuse software where possible (to limit the code we own) but favouring duplication over reuse if it makes things easier to manage\n- If integrating or working with legacy systems, bear in mind that they often weren’t designed for iterative change cycles, so the pace of change is slowed\n","38":" What is EForms?\nEForms is a set of web forms used to apply for criminal legal aid. EForms is also used to submit certain types of billing claims against criminal legal aid applications - including claims for non-standard magistrates fees, claims for prior authority costs, requests to increase the upper limit for advice on appeal, and claims for payment on account.\n\n","39":" What relationships does EForms have to LAA digital systems?\n- eForms writes to MAAT via LAA Hub jobs to submit criminal legal aid applications\n- eForms calls to LAA Portal to authenticate users\n- MAAT writes to EForms via LAA Hub jobs to send legal aid decisions and status updates.\n- CWA writes to eForms via LAA Hub jobs to send data about legal aid providers.\n\n","40":" Who looks after EForms?\nEForms is run and maintained by Equiniti. LAA have a contract with Equiniti for the use of EForms for legal aid purposes.\n\n","41":" How old is EForms?\nEForms was first created in early 2010s. It became mandatory for criminal legal aid applications in 2016.\n\n","42":" Who are the users of EForms?\n- EForms is used by legal aid providers to submit applications for criminal legal aid and to submit certain types of billing claim for criminal legal aid.\n- EForms is used by legal aid caseworkers to review applications for criminal legal aid and to review certain types of billing claim for criminal legal aid.\n","43":" Where are LAA digital software systems hosted?\nLAA digital software systems are hosted in one of four places:\n- LAA Landing Zone\n- Cloud platform\n- Modernisation Platform\n- 6 Degrees\n\n","44":" What is the LAA Landing Zone?\nThe LAA Landing Zone hosts LAA software systems in the the AWS London region. The LAA Landing Zone was created as a space to 'lift and shift' older systems that were previously running in on-premises hosting into AWS cloud. It was designed to simplify the initial migration of these systems but with the intention that those systems would then be moved into other AWS platforms with better standards and guardrails, namely Cloud Platform and Modernisation Platform. Systems that run on LAA Landing Zone will therefore need to be migrated into Cloud Platform or Modernisation Platform over the coming years. The LAA Landing Zone is run by the LAA Ops team.\n\n","45":" What is the Cloud Platform?\nThe Ministry of Justice’s Cloud Platform is a hosting platform for digital services built within the Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe Cloud Platform uses the Amazon EKS service.\n\nThe Cloud Platform is the default choice for hosting new software applications run by LAA digital.\n\nThe user guide at https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/ provides more information for teams that use the Cloud Platform.\n\n","46":" What is the Modernisation Platform?\nThe Ministry of Justice’s Modernisation Platform is a hosting platform for digital services built within the Ministry of Justice. It provides an alternative hosting option to the Ministry of Justice’s Cloud Platform, for software that is not suited to running in AWS EKS.\n\nThe user guide at https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/provides more information for teams that use the Modernisation Platform.\n\n","47":" What is 6 Degrees?\nLAA digital uses the term '6 Degrees' to refer to the historical hosting platform for LAA software applications. We have migrated nearly all of those software applications away from 6 Degrees and into AWS hosting - initially to the LAA Landing Zone. The EBS component of CCMS is still running in 6 Degrees hosting, however. VPNs connect 6 Degrees to the LAA Landing Zone to provide connectivity between EBS and other CCMS components.\n\n","48":" Where should new LAA Digital services be hosted?\nNew services should be hosted in the MOJ Cloud Platform. If teams feel that the service cannot be appropriately run on Kubernetes in Amazon EKS then teams can consider using MOJ Modernisation Platform instead.\n\n","49":" How can services in different MOJ platforms communicate with each other?\nhe MOJ Transit Gateway provides connectivity between Cloud Platform, Modernisation Platform, and the LAA Landing Zone. Services can also communicate over the internet via API endpoints. \n","50":" What is InfoX?\nInfoX is a software system used to connect legal aid systems with a court system called Libra.\n\n","51":" What relationships does InfoX have to other software systems?\n- InfoX calls to Libra to search court case information and send updates on the status of criminal legal aid applications.\n- Libra calls to InfoX to send court case hearing updates.\n- Infox uses a SOAP Gateway to connect with Libra.\n- InfoX is an adaptor and does not persist the data it receives. Instead it writes court case updates to the MAAT database.\n- The MLRA system calls to InfoX to search for court case data.\n- The NoLASA system calls to InfoX to check for court case updates.\n\n","52":" Where is InfoX hosted?\nInfoX is hosted in the LAA Landing Zone, which uses the AWS London region.\n\n","53":" Who looks after InfoX?\nInfoX is maintained by the Crime Core team in LAA Digital.\n\n","54":" What type of software is InfoX?\nInfoX is an adaptor to the Libra system run by HMCTS. It is a Java application and uses Tomee and the SpringMVC framework. It runs on Java 8. It is not regularly updated.\n\n","55":" How old is InfoX?\nThe first code commit for InfoX was pushed on 19th May 2017. The history of the project before that is unknown.\n\n","56":" What is the future of InfoX?\nHMCTS are replacing the Libra system with a new service called Common Platform. Once the replacement is complete, the Legal Aid Agency will no longer need to communicate with the Libra system and InfoX can be decommissioned. It is highly likely that InfoX will be needed until this time since there are no plans to build an alternative adaptor to Libra.\n","57":" What programming languages are used by LAA digital teams?\nWhilst encouraging alignment, LAA digital prefers to give teams the autonomy to make the software choices that best fit their context rather than mandating a technology stack. That said, LAA digital does favour open-source over closed-source software.\n\nWhen developing new software, LAA digital teams tend to use either Ruby on Rails, Python or Java.\n\nLAA digital also has legacy systems with large amounts of PL/SQL code.\n\n","58":" What technical standards do LAA digital teams use?\nLAA digital teams follow:\n- The UK digital service standard when building new services (https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard)\n- UK government standards when designing APIs (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards)\n- UK government accessibility standards (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps)\n- Ministry of Justice cyber security guidance (https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/#cyber-and-technical-security-guidance)\n- Ministry of Justice architecture principles (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XBTuCw0y--4fZpHcTLWilSFx_qz3aewTiWYJGTZU4sA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n","59":" What tooling do LAA digital software teams use?\nLAA digital teams have autonomy to choose the tooling that best fits their context. Alignment of tooling can help with sharing of best practice, onboarding time, troubleshooting. Tools that are commonly used by LAA digital teams include:\n- Snyk: vulnerability scanning\n- Sentry: error monitoring\n- SonarCloud: code analysis\n- Prometheus: metrics monitoring\n- Kibana / ELK: log viewing\n- AlertManager: handling alerts\n- Geckoboard: dashboarding\n- Tuple: pair programming\n\n","60":" How many software systems does LAA digital have?\nLAA digital is responsible for around 90 software systems; the exact number depends on how you define a software system. The number of systems has increased year on year as LAA digital teams:\n- a) uncover 'shadow' or 'unsupported' systems that are still needed but are not managed or owned by any team\n- b) replace large monolithic software with micro-services\n- c) struggle to decommission older systems\n\n","61":" Why does LAA digital have so many software systems?\nLAA digital has steadily accumulated software over the past 25 years. Some possible reasons for this are:\n- a) The natural tendency for organisations to accumulate software as more of their processes are digitised\n- b) The variousness of legal aid. There isn’t a single legal aid journey, there are a number of fundamentally different ones (civil, criminal, legal advice, representation in court). Each one represents a different process with its own language, rules and context for users. Generally speaking, we have found that an entirely different set of services are needed for each legal aid journey type.\n- c) The complexity of legal aid. From a software perspective, we find lots of business logic that is unique to legal aid. This impacts the size of our technical estate because our services tend to require lots of different component capabilities, which are - often appropriately - run as separate software applications.\n- d) The [challenges of legacy displacement](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-legacy-displacement/) and the need to 'dual run' new micro-services with older monolithic systems until they are fully replaced\n- e) The need for 'transitional architecture' as we modernise and replace our legacy systems, such as additional APIs and adaptors for integrating new services with those systems\n\n","62":" What kind of software does LAA digital have?\nLAA digital has software that supports over a million legal aid applications and over £2 billion in legal aid payments every year, giving those who need it access to justice.\n\nLAA digital has a range of software types including:\n- online application forms\n- eligibility calculators\n- caseworking systems\n- payment systems\n\nThe nature and condition of these systems varies. One significant factor is whether the system was built before or after LAA digital was created in 2016:\n\n- From around 2000 to 2016, the LAA built systems and digitised a whole raft of paper-based processes using Oracle  products like EBS, Oracle Database, and APEX. As a result, Oracle now powers most of the LAA digital’s biggest systems - CCMS, CWA, CCR, CCLF, MAAT, MLRA, OAS, ERIC, CIS, PIMS, TV, IFS, etc. Legal aid wouldn’t happen without these systems and the teams that look after them -  together they support over a million legal aid applications and over £2 billion in payments every year, giving people who need it access to justice. However, these systems are also problematic: they are fragile and hard to change, and the knowledge they require is increasingly difficult to find and retain. With significant changes to legal aid policy on the horizon (such as the Means Test Review, CLAIR, etc), the struggle to keep these systems operational isn’t getting any easier.\n\n- LAA digital was formed in 2016 as part of a GDS-led movement to bring modern digital approaches into government. LAA digital created a number of autonomous cross-functional product teams to build new services in line with the UK digital service standard. LAA digital shifted towards favouring open source technologies, in particular Ruby, Python and Java.\n\n","63":" What is the future of LAA digital systems?\n- LAA digital is working to reduce dependency on systems that meet the government definition of 'legacy' https://www.gov.uk/guidance/managing-legacy-technology.\n- The process of legacy transformation will likely continue through a mix of 'replacement' and 'modernisation' of LAA digital's older systems.\n- LAA digital has favoured an iterative approach to replacement - picking off capabilities from legacy systems one-by-one rather than replacing whole systems as a big bang. This method has the advantage of enabling teams to release value quicker and get users into the feedback loop as early as possible. It does however mean lots of ‘dual running’.\n- LAA digital has entered a ‘transitional state’, during which its technical estate will grow before it can be streamlined back down. This is because LAA digital's biggest legacy systems were not designed in a way that allows specific components to be isolated and turned off as new services come along.\n- During this period, many legacy systems will continue to be critical to the functioning of legal aid and will need to be appropriately modernised so that they remain operational, secure, and updated in line with legal aid policy changes. This modernisation process will continue to be challenging.\n- LAA digital is designing more resilient and adaptable systems in order to help achieve the goal of creating 'simplified and more reliable access to legal aid services'. LAA Digital teams are also working to make sure that systems surface the right data to help drive decisions around simplification and automation.\n","64":" How many teams does LAA digital have?\nLAA digital has a number of product teams with services in beta or live phases:\n- Civil Apply\n- CCMS Civil Applications\n- CCMS Civil Billing\n- CCMS Platform\n- Crime Core\n- Crime Modernisation\n- Crime Apply\n- Crime Review\n- CLA (Civil Legal Advice)\n- PCUAM (Provider Contracts and User Access Management)\n- CCQ (Check if your Client Qualifies for legal aid)\n- DART (Data and Reporting)\n\nLAA digital also has teams exploring in discovery or alpha phases:\n- Non-Standard Magistrates Claims\n- Finance\n- Eligibility Platform\n- Meant Test Review\n\nIn addition, LAA digital has a couple of supporting teams:\n- SMT (Senior Management Team)\n- LAA Digital Support\n\n","65":" What is the strategy of LAA digital?\nThe strategy for LAA digital is reflected in the [Ministry of Justice Digital strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ministry-of-justice-digital-strategy-2025) for 2022 to 2025.\n\n","66":" Acronyms\nUseful acronyms for LAA Digital and MOJ are listed on [https://ministry-of-justice-acronyms.service.justice.gov.uk](https://ministry-of-justice-acronyms.service.justice.gov.uk/).\n\n","67":" More information\n- [About our tech estate](/docs/laa-digital-tech)\n- [Our hosting platforms](/docs/hosting)\n- [Domain model](/docs/domains)\n- [Identity and user management](/docs/identity)\n- [Service standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard)\n","68":" What is LAA Portal?\nLAA Portal (also known as the LAA Online Portal, and just Portal) is used to authenticate users to LAA web services. Users, both internal and external, login to the LAA Portal and are presented with a list of services they can access.\n\n","69":" What relationships does LAA Portal have to other software systems?\nMany LAA Digital systems integrate with Portal in order to authenticate users of their service:\n- CCMS PUI\n- CCMS EBS\n- Civil Apply\n- CCR\n- CCLF\n- Crime Apply\n- EForms\n- CWA\n- OAS\n\nCWA connects to LAA Portal via LAA Hub and ODIP to send Portal data about new users and updates to existing users\n\n","70":" Where is LAA Portal hosted?\nLAA Portal is hosted in the LAA Landing Zone, which uses the AWS London region.\n\n","71":" Who looks after LAA Portal?\nLAA Portal is maintained by the PCUAM team (Provider Contracts and User Access Management) in LAA Digital.\n\n","72":" What type of software is LAA Portal?\nLAA Portal is an identity service that consists of:\n- OID (Oracle Internet Directory): LDAP directory\n- OAM (Oracle Access Manager): access control\n- OIM (Oracle Identity Manager)\n- Oracle Database\n- A custom Java application that serves the login and homepage\n- LAA Service Status dashboard: ReactJS app that provides users with status updates on LAA web services\n\nThe portal acts as a SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) Identity Provider (IDP).  Other applications (SAML Service Providers (SP)) can then authenticate and receive authorisation information from the Portal.\n\n","73":" Who are the users of LAA Portal?\nThe LAA Portal serves a wide range of internal and external users who need access to LAA systems.\n\n","74":" What is the future of the LAA Portal?\nLAA Digital continues to review the identity space. LAA Portal is a potential candidate for being replaced with a newer identity provider, subject to the outcomes of discovery into the space. A key challenge for any replacement would be the need to smoothly manage the transition of users and systems to a new service.\n","75":" What is Libra?\nLibra is a case management system for magistrates court cases.\n\n","76":" What relationships does Libra have to LAA digital systems?\n- InfoX calls to Libra to search court case information and send updates on the status of criminal legal aid applications.\n- Libra calls to InfoX to send court case hearing updates.\n\n","77":" Who looks after Libra?\nLibra is run and maintained by HMCTS.\n\n","78":" What is the future of Libra?\nHMCTS are replacing the Libra system with a new service called Common Platform.\n","79":" What is the MAAT API service?\nMAAT API is a software service that acts as an interface to the MAAT database.\n\n","80":" What relationships does MAAT API have to other software systems?\n- MAAT API connects to the MAAT database\n- MAAT API transfers data to Court Data Adaptor via SQS to send legal aid status updates to Common Platform.\n- Court Data Adaptor transfers data to MAAT API via SQS to send court cause updates from Common Platform.\n- Crime Means Assessment calls to the MAAT API to save means assessments to the MAAT database.\n\n","81":" Where is MAAT API hosted?\nMAAT API is hosted in the LAA Landing Zone, which uses the AWS London region.\n\n","82":" Who looks after MAAT API?\nMAAT API is maintained by the Crime Core team in LAA Digital.\n\n","83":" What type of software is MAAT API?\nMAAT API provides a RESTful interface to the MAAT database. MAAT API implements the OpenAPI standard. MAAT API is a Java based Spring Boot application. MAAT API currently only supports a subset of interactions with the MAAT database, those relating to court data and means assessment data.\n\n","84":" Who are the users of MAAT API?\nMAAT API is only consumed by other software systems.\n\n","85":" How old is MAAT API?\nMAAT API was created in 2020.\n\n","86":" What is the future of MAAT API?\nMAAT API will likely expand to support other new services that need to interact with the MAAT database and require a modern RESTful interface to do so.\n","87":" What is MAAT?\nMAAT is a software system used by caseworkers to assess applications for criminal legal aid. MAAT stands for Means Assessment Administration Tool.\n\n","88":" What relationships does MAAT have to other software systems?\n- MAAT calls to Benefit Checker to get benefit entitlement status for legal aid applicants.\n- MAAT writes to EDW via LAA Hub jobs to send MI and casework performance data.\n- MAAT writes to eForms via LAA Hub jobs to send legal aid decisions and status updates.\n- MAAT writes to Marstons via LAA Hub jobs to send applicant contribution and debt amounts.\n- MAAT writes to ePrint via LAA Hub jobs to request the printing and sending of letters.\n- MAAT calls to the Crime Means Assessment service to request financial eligibility calculations.\n- The MLRA system connects to the MAAT database.\n- The NoLASA system connects to the MAAT database.\n- The InfoX system saves Magistrates court updates to the MAAT database.\n- CCR calls to MAAT via LAA Hub jobs to load defendant data\n- CCLF calls to MAAT via LAA Hub jobs to load defendant data\n- CWA writes to MAAT via LAA Hub jobs to send provider details\n- Xhibit writes to MAAT via LAA Hub jobs to send Crown Court updates\n- Eforms writes to MAAT via LAA Hub jobs to submit criminal legal aid applications\n- MAAT API calls the MAAT database to update court case and means assessment data\n\n","89":" Where is MAAT hosted?\nMAAT is hosted in the LAA Landing Zone, which uses the AWS London region.\n\n","90":" Who looks after MAAT?\nMAAT is maintained by the Crime Core team in LAA Digital.\n\n","91":" What type of software is MAAT?\nMAAT is a caseworking system that is used to process criminal legal aid applications. MAAT is a Java application that uses Tomee. It runs on Java 8. The MAAT database is an Oracle Database running in AWS RDS. The MAAT database also has significant amounts of business logic contained in PL/SQL.\n\n","92":" Who are the users of MAAT?\nMAAT is used by LAA caseworkers to process applications for criminal legal aid\n\n\n","93":" How old is MAAT?\nMAAT was created in around 2008.\n\n","94":" What is the future of MAAT?\nMAAT is a 'legacy' application that is undergoing a modernisation programme. In order to safely implement upcoming changes to legal aid policy, the Crime Modernisation team decided to remove core capabilities from MAAT and 'lift and shift' them into new micro-services that will be easier and safer to implement changes in. The first of these capabilities is the 'Crime Means Assessment' service, which is now built and live - this means that MAAT no longer performs means calculations itself, but instead calls out to the new service. More functional capabilities are being pulled out of MAAT and into new services. At first, these new capabilities will use the MAAT database to persist data (this is because many downstream processes still rely on the data existing in the MAAT database). A future phase of the modernisation process will be to move this data out of the MAAT database and ensure that all relevant integrations are updated. Eventually, the MAAT UI might also be replaced by the new Crime Review service, and LAA digital might be in a position to sunset or decommission MAAT.\n","95":" What is MLRA?\nMLRA is a software system used by LAA caseworkers to interact with the Libra system and to manage representation orders for criminal legal aid. MLRA stands for Managed Libra Records Application.\n\n","96":" What relationships does MLRA have to other software systems?\n- MLRA connects to the MAAT database.\n- MLRA calls to InfoX to search for court data and to send legal aid status updates to Libra\n\n","97":" Where is MLRA hosted?\nMLRA is hosted in the LAA Landing Zone, which uses the AWS London region.\n\n","98":" Who looks after MLRA?\nMLRA is maintained by the Crime Core team in LAA Digital.\n\n","99":" What type of software is MLRA?\nMLRA is a tool that supports caseworkers when processing criminal legal aid applications. MLRA is used to communicate between the MAAT application and the magistrate court system (LIBRA via INFOX). MLRA also manages the handling of representation orders for criminal legal aid. MLRA is a Java application that uses Tomee. It runs on Java 8. MLRA connects to the MAAT database, which is an Oracle Database running in AWS RDS.\n\n","100":" Who are the users of MLRA?\nMLRA is used by criminal legal aid caseworkers as a web service.\n\n","101":" How old is MLRA?\nMLRA was created in around 2014.\n\n","102":" What is the future of MLRA?\nMLRA is considered to be a legacy software application. The capabilities of MLRA might one day be replaced as part of the MAAT modernisations programme.\n","103":" What is NoLASA?\nNoLASA is a software system used to auto-search the Libra system for court case data.\n\n","104":" What is the background context for NoLASA?\nThe Managed Libra records application (MLRA) is an LAA system that shares a database with the means assessment administration tool (MAAT). It links cases to their corresponding cases in the HMCTS Libra system. This is for the purposes of tracking cases through the course / Legal Aid system in a joined up way (i.e. updates of a person's status through the courts system is updated in LAA systems once a case is linked).\n\nIf an LAA caseworker searches for a case on the Libra system using MLRA and they are unable to find a corresponding case (this can happen for numerous reasons, for instance a Legal Aid application being submitted by a legal provider before the police/courts have added onto LIBRA), the case is marked by a caseworker as 'NOT ON LIBRA' and places onto a backlog queue (the 'not on libra' queue). Case workers will then research these cases at a later date to see if the corresponding case is now on Libra system.\n\nThis researching can take time as there is not a great way of prioritizing cases that may be on Libra. This is where the Nolasa application comes in.\n\n","105":" How does NoLASA work?\nNot On Libra Auto-Search Application (NOLASA) is a micro-service that reads cases that have been marked as 'not-on-libra' from the MLRA database once a day (8pm). It then auto-searches the HMCTS Libra system via the LAA's Infox message broker service. The message protocol used is SOAP.\n\nIf NOLASA finds that there are results returned for a case it updates its status in MLRA to say 'RESULTS FOUND'. This means that caseworkers can filter 'not on libra' cases to ones that they know they will have results for. They can then prioritize their case searching and linking more effectively.\n\n","106":" What relationships does NoLASA have to other software systems?\n- NoLASA connects to the MAAT database.\n- NoLASA calls to InfoX to perform searches of Libra\n\n","107":" Where is NoLASA hosted?\nNoLASA is hosted in the LAA Landing Zone, which uses the AWS London region.\n\n","108":" Who looks after NoLASA?\nNoLASA is maintained by the Crime Core team in LAA Digital.\n\n","109":" What type of software is NoLASA?\nThe NOSALA micro-service has been developed using Springboot framework with enbedded Tomcat server. Tomcat is fully contained in the fat JAR file. Gradle packages executable JAR file which is deployed as Docker image on AWS ECS.\n\n","110":" How old is NoLASA?\nThe first code commit for NOSALA was pushed on 8th August 2017. The history of the project before that is unknown.\n\n","111":" What is the future of NoLASA?\nHMCTS are replacing the Libra system with a new service called Common Platform. Once the replacement is complete, the Legal Aid Agency will no longer need to communicate with the Libra system and NOSALA can be decommissioned. It is highly likely that NOSALA will be needed until this time since there are no plans to build an alternative auto-search for Libra.\n","112":" What security guidance should LAA Digital teams use?\nLAA Digital teams should:\n- Follow the Ministry of Justice cyber security guidance - https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/#cyber-and-technical-security-guidance\n- Be aware of the OWASP list of common vulnerabilities when developing applications - https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/\n- If unsure, refer to the MoJ Cyber Security team (who can be messaged in the #security Slack channel)\n\n","113":" What should LAA Digital teams do if they have a security related incident?\n\nTeams should assess the impact of any breach and take any immediate action to secure their applications and data.\n\nSecurity incidents will happen, teams should not worry about informing others and flagging suspected breaches. You should inform:\n- The LAA Technical Architects\n- The MoJ Cyber Security team (via the #security Slack channel)\n- Any other teams who have services that might be effected\n- If appropriate, the LAA Digital SMT and other stakeholders\n\nOnce the incident is resolved, it is important to learn the lessons of the breach and put in place any appropriate mitigations and controls. A retrospective or postmortem should be held to help facilitate this.\n\n","114":" What security testing should LAA Digital teams do before releasing new software services?\nIt is normal for LAA Digital teams to carry out an ITHC before releasing new services to private or public beta. It is also recommended to hold a threat vulnerability modelling session (TVM) prior to the ITHC, which can help to form the scope for the ITHC testing. The MoJ Cyber Security team can help to facilitate TVM sessions with teams.\n\nLAA Digital teams also use security tooling as standard:\n- Snyk for vulnerability scanning\n- SonarCloud for code analysis\n- Sentry for error monitoring\n- ModSec as a web application firewall (this can be configured for services running on MoJ Cloud Platform https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/networking/modsecurity.html)\n\nFor other security tooling and testing techniques, please refer to the LAA Developer (Slack #laa-developers) and Cyber Security (Slack #security) communities.\n","115":" What is Xhibit?\nXhibit is a case management system for crown court cases.\n\n","116":" What relationships does Xhibit have to LAA digital systems?\n- MAAT calls to Xhibit via LAA Hub to send updates on the status of criminal legal aid applications.\n- Xhibit calls to MAAT database via LAA Hub to send court case updates.\n\n","117":" Who looks after Xhibit?\nXhibit is run and maintained by HMCTS.\n\n","118":" What is the future of Xhibit?\nHMCTS are replacing the Xhibit system with a new service called Common Platform.\n"}
