Crime Means Assessment can be used to create, update, or retrieve means assessment results.\n\n","21":" What relationships does Crime Means Assessment have to other software systems?\n- Crime Means Assessment calls to the MAAT API to save means assessments to the MAAT database.\n- MAAT calls to the Crime Means Assessment service to request financial eligibility calculations.\n\n","22":" Where is Crime Means Assessment hosted?\nCrime Means Assessment is hosted in the MOJ Cloud Platform, which uses the AWS London region.\n\n","23":" Who looks after Crime Means Assessment?\nCrime Means Assessment is maintained by the Crime Modernisation team in LAA Digital.\n\n","24":" What type of software is Crime Means Assessment?\nCrime Means Assessment is an eligibility calculator that takes information about a criminal legal aid applicant and assesses whether they are financially eligible for legal aid. Crime Means Assessment is a Java based Spring Boot application and uses a Postgres database. Crime Means Assessment can be considered a micro-service that encapsulates crime means assessment.\n\n","25":" Who are the users of Crime Means Assessment?\nCrime Means Assessment is used by the MAAT system.\n\n","26":" How old is Crime Means Assessment?\nCrime Means Assessment was created in 2022.\n\n","27":" What is the future of Crime Means Assessment?\nCrime Means Assessment was developed as part of the MAAT modernisation programme. It replaces the capability in MAAT for assessing the financial eligibility of legal aid applicants. In future a decision will need to be made about who manages the Crime Means Assessment service. Currently it is maintained by the Crime Modernisation team but this responsibility might move to the Eligibility Platform team. Crime Means Assessment might also be refactored to more closely align to the patterns used by other LAA digital eligibility calculators.\n","28":" What is EForms?\nEForms is a set of web forms used to apply for criminal legal aid. EForms is also used to submit certain types of billing claims against criminal legal aid applications - including claims for non-standard magistrates fees, claims for prior authority costs, requests to increase the upper limit for advice on appeal, and claims for payment on account.\n\n","29":" What relationships does EForms have to LAA digital systems?\n- eForms writes to MAAT via LAA Hub jobs to submit criminal legal aid applications\n- eForms calls to LAA Portal to authenticate users\n- MAAT writes to EForms via LAA Hub jobs to send legal aid decisions and status updates.\n- CWA writes to eForms via LAA Hub jobs to send data about legal aid providers.\n\n","30":" Who looks after EForms?\nEForms is run and maintained by Equiniti.

The LAA Landing Zone was created as a space to 'lift and shift' older systems that were previously running in on-premises hosting into AWS cloud. It was designed to simplify the initial migration of these systems but with the intention that those systems would then be moved into other AWS platforms with better standards and guardrails, namely Cloud Platform and Modernisation Platform. Systems that run on LAA Landing Zone will therefore need to be migrated into Cloud Platform or Modernisation Platform over the coming years. The LAA Landing Zone is run by the LAA Ops team.\n\n","34":" What is the Cloud Platform?\nThe Ministry of Justice’s Cloud Platform is a hosting platform for digital services built within the Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe Cloud Platform uses the Amazon EKS service.\n\nThe Cloud Platform is the default choice for hosting new software applications run by LAA digital.\n\nThe user guide at https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/ provides more information for teams that use the Cloud Platform.\n\n","35":" What is the Modernisation Platform?\nThe Ministry of Justice’s Modernisation Platform is a hosting platform for digital services built within the Ministry of Justice. It provides an alternative hosting option to the Ministry of Justice’s Cloud Platform, for software that is not suited to running in AWS EKS.\n\nThe user guide at https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/provides more information for teams that use the Modernisation Platform.\n\n","36":" What is 6 Degrees?\nLAA digital uses the term '6 Degrees' to refer to the historical hosting platform for LAA software applications. We have migrated nearly all of those software applications away from 6 Degrees and into AWS hosting - initially to the LAA Landing Zone. The EBS component of CCMS is still running in 6 Degrees hosting, however. VPNs connect 6 Degrees to the LAA Landing Zone to provide connectivity between EBS and other CCMS components.\n","37":" What is InfoX?\nInfoX is a software system used to connect legal aid systems with a court system called Libra.\n\n","38":" What relationships does InfoX have to other software systems?\n- InfoX calls to Libra to search court case information and send updates on the status of criminal legal aid applications.\n- Libra calls to InfoX to send court case hearing updates.\n- Infox uses a SOAP Gateway to connect with Libra.\n- InfoX is an adaptor and does not persist the data it receives. Instead it writes court case updates to the MAAT database.\n- The MLRA system calls to InfoX to search for court case data.\n- The NoLASA system calls to InfoX to check for court case updates.\n\n","39":" Where is InfoX hosted?\nInfoX is hosted in the LAA Landing Zone, which uses the AWS London region.\n\n","40":" Who looks after InfoX?\nInfoX is maintained by the Crime Core team in LAA Digital.\n\n","41":" What type of software is InfoX?\nInfoX is an adaptor to the Libra system run by HMCTS. It is a Java application and uses Tomee and the SpringMVC framework. It runs on Java 8. It is not regularly updated.\n\n","42":" How old is InfoX?\nThe first code commit for InfoX was pushed on 19th May 2017. The history of the project before that is unknown.\n\n","43":" What is the future of InfoX?\nHMCTS are replacing the Libra system with a new service called Common Platform. Once the replacement is complete, the Legal Aid Agency will no longer need to communicate with the Libra system and InfoX can be decommissioned. It is highly likely that InfoX will be needed until this time since there are no plans to build an alternative adaptor to Libra.\n","44":" How many teams does LAA digital have?\nLAA digital has a number of product teams with services in beta or live phases:\n- Civil Apply\n- CCMS Civil Applications\n- CCMS Civil Billing\n- CCMS Platform\n- Crime Core\n- Crime Modernisation\n- Crime Apply\n- Crime Review\n- CLA (Civil Legal Advice)\n- PCUAM (Provider Contracts and User Access Management)\n- CCQ (Check if your Client Qualifies for legal aid)\n- DART (Data and Reporting)\n\nLAA digital also has teams exploring in discovery or alpha phases:\n- Non-Standard Magistrates Claims\n- Finance\n- Eligibility Platform\n- Meant Test Review\n\nIn addition, LAA digital has a couple of supporting teams:\n- SMT (Senior Management Team)\n- LAA Digital Support\n\n","45":" How many software systems does LAA digital have?\nLAA digital is responsible for around 90 software systems; the exact number depends on how you define a software system. The number of systems has increased year on year as LAA digital teams:\n- a) uncover 'shadow' or 'unsupported' systems that are still needed but are not managed or owned by any team\n- b) replace large monolithic software with micro-services\n- c) struggle to decommission older systems\n\n","46":" Why does LAA digital have so many software systems?\nLAA digital has steadily accumulated software over the past 25 years. Some possible reasons for this are:\n- a) The natural tendency for organisations to accumulate software as more of their processes are digitised\n- b) The variousness of legal aid. There isn’t a single legal aid journey, there are a number of fundamentally different ones (civil, criminal, legal advice, representation in court). Each one represents a different process with its own language, rules and context for users. Generally speaking, we have found that an entirely different set of services are needed for each legal aid journey type.\n- c) The complexity of legal aid. From a software perspective, we find lots of business logic that is unique to legal aid. This impacts the size of our technical estate because our services tend to require lots of different component capabilities, which are - often appropriately - run as separate software applications.\n- d) The need to 'dual run' new micro-services with older monolithic systems until they are fully replaced\n- e) The need for 'transitional architecture' as we modernise and replace our legacy systems, such as additional APIs and adaptors for integrating new services with those systems\n- f) The MVP Trap. When replacing systems, digital teams are keen to release value quickly and get users into the feedback loop (rightly so!). To do this, they tend to focus MVP scope on high-value, low-effort areas. The ‘trap’ is that once you’ve done the highest-value lowest-effort parts, you are - by definition - left with a tail of lower-value higher-effort ones. It’s very easy for that tail to then get de-prioritised in favour of other, newer business priorities, leaving the old system never fully replaced.\n\n","47":" What kind of software does LAA digital have?\nLAA digital has software that supports over a million legal aid applications and over £2 billion in legal aid payments every year, giving those who need it access to justice.\n\nLAA digital has a range of software types including online application forms, eligibility calculators, caseworking systems, and payment systems. The nature and condition of these systems varies a lot - a key factor is whether the system was built before or after LAA digital was created in 2016:\n\n- From around 2000 to 2016, the LAA built systems and digitised a whole raft of paper-based processes using Oracle  products like EBS, Oracle Database, and APEX. As a result, Oracle now powers most of the LAA digital’s biggest systems - CCMS, CWA, CCR, CCLF, MAAT, MLRA, OAS, ERIC, CIS, PIMS, TV, IFS, etc. Legal aid wouldn’t happen without these systems and the teams that look after them -  together they support over a million legal aid applications and over £2 billion in payments every year, giving people who need it access to justice. However, these systems are also problematic: they are fragile and hard to change, and the knowledge they require is increasingly difficult to find and retain. With significant changes to legal aid policy on the horizon (such as the Means Test Review, CLAIR, etc), the struggle to keep these systems operational isn’t getting any easier.\n\n- LAA digital was formed in 2016 as part of a GDS-led movement to bring modern digital approaches into government. LAA digital created a number of autonomous cross-functional product teams to build new services in line with the UK digital service standard. LAA digital shifted towards favouring open source technologies, in particular Ruby, Python and Java.\n\n","48":" What is the strategy of LAA digital?\nThe strategy for LAA digital is reflected in the Ministry of Justice Digital strategy for 2022 to 2025 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ministry-of-justice-digital-strategy-2025.\n\n","49":" What is the future of LAA digital systems?\n- LAA digital will continue trying to reduce the LAA's dependency on systems that meet the government definition of 'legacy' https://www.gov.uk/guidance/managing-legacy-technology.\n- The process of legacy transformation will continue through a mix of 'replacement' and 'modernisation' of LAA digital's older systems.\n- LAA digital will continue favouring an iterative approach to replacement - picking off capabilities from legacy systems one-by-one rather than replacing whole systems as a big bang. This method has the advantage of enabling teams to release value quicker and get users into the feedback loop as early as possible. It does however mean lots of ‘dual running’.\n- LAA digital has entered a ‘transitional state’, during which its technical estate will grow significantly before it can be streamlined back down. This is because LAA digital's biggest legacy systems were not designed in a way that allows specific components to be isolated and turned off as new services come along. New services will need to dual run with older systems until enough capabilities have been replaced to turn the older systems off. This enlarged state will likely last for at least 10 years.\n- During this period, many legacy systems will continue to be critical to the functioning of legal aid and will need to be appropriately modernised so that they remain operational, secure, and updated in line with legal aid policy changes. This modernisation process will continue to be challenging for LAA digital teams because the commercial products behind these systems were customised so much that they no longer resemble ‘off-the-shelf’ products but instead are unique LAA applications, often pinned to old versions of the underlying software.\n- To achieve the goal of creating 'simplified and more reliable access to legal aid services', LAA digital will need to design resilient and adaptable services, and make sure that systems surface the right data to help drive decisions around simplification and automation.\n\n","50":" What programming languages are used by LAA digital teams?\nWhilst encouraging alignment, LAA digital prefers to give teams the autonomy to make the software choices that best fit their context rather than mandating a technology stack. That said, LAA digital does favour open-source over closed-source software.\n\nWhen developing new software, LAA digital teams tend to use either Ruby on Rails, Python or Java.\n\nLAA digital also has legacy systems with large amounts of PL/SQL code.\n\n","51":" What technical standards do LAA digital teams use?\nLAA digital teams follow:\n- The UK digital service standard when building new services (https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard)\n- UK government standards when designing APIs (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards)\n- UK government accessibility standards (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps)\n- Ministry of Justice cyber security guidance (https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/#cyber-and-technical-security-guidance)\n- Ministry of Justice architecture principles (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XBTuCw0y--4fZpHcTLWilSFx_qz3aewTiWYJGTZU4sA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n","52":" What tooling do LAA digital software teams use?\nLAA digital teams have autonomy to choose the tooling that best fits their context. Alignment of tooling can help with sharing of best practice, onboarding time, troubleshooting. Tools that are commonly used by LAA digital teams include:\n- Snyk: vulnerability scanning\n- Sentry: error monitoring\n- SonarCloud: code analysis\n- Prometheus: metrics monitoring\n- Kibana / ELK: log viewing\n- AlertManager: handling alerts\n- Geckoboard: dashboarding\n- Tuple: pair programming\n","53":" What is Libra?\nLibra is a case management system for magistrates court cases.\n\n","54":" What relationships does Libra have to LAA digital systems?\n- InfoX calls to Libra to search court case information and send updates on the status of criminal legal aid applications.\n- Libra calls to InfoX to send court case hearing updates.\n\n","55":" Who looks after Libra?\nLibra is run and maintained by HMCTS.\n\n","56":" What is the future of Libra?\nHMCTS are replacing the Libra system with a new service called Common Platform.\n","57":" What is the MAAT API service?\nMAAT API is a software service that acts as an interface to the MAAT database.\n\n","58":" What relationships does MAAT API have to other software systems?\n- MAAT API connects to the MAAT database\n- MAAT API transfers data to Court Data Adaptor via SQS to send legal aid status updates to Common Platform.\n- Court Data Adaptor transfers data to MAAT API via SQS to send court cause updates from Common Platform.\n- Crime Means Assessment calls to the MAAT API to save means assessments to the MAAT database.\n\n","59":" Where is MAAT API hosted?\nMAAT API is hosted in the LAA Landing Zone, which uses the AWS London region.\n\n","60":" Who looks after MAAT API?\nMAAT API is maintained by the Crime Core team in LAA Digital.\n\n","61":" What type of software is MAAT API?\nMAAT API provides a RESTful interface to the MAAT database. MAAT API implements the OpenAPI standard. MAAT API is a Java based Spring Boot application. MAAT API currently only supports a subset of interactions with the MAAT database, those relating to court data and means assessment data.\n\n","62":" Who are the users of MAAT API?\nMAAT API is only consumed by other software systems.\n\n","63":" How old is MAAT API?\nMAAT API was created in 2020.\n\n","64":" What is the future of MAAT API?\nMAAT API will likely expand to support other new services that need to interact with the MAAT database and require a modern RESTful interface to do so.\n","65":" What is MAAT?\nMAAT is a software system used by caseworkers to assess applications for criminal legal aid. MAAT stands for Means Assessment Administration Tool.\n\n","66":" What relationships does MAAT have to other software systems?\n- MAAT calls to Benefit Checker to get benefit entitlement status for legal aid applicants.\n- MAAT writes to EDW via LAA Hub jobs to send MI and casework performance data.\n- MAAT writes to eForms via LAA Hub jobs to send legal aid decisions and status updates.\n- MAAT writes to Marstons via LAA Hub jobs to send applicant contribution and debt amounts.\n- MAAT writes to ePrint via LAA Hub jobs to request the printing and sending of letters.\n- MAAT calls to the Crime Means Assessment service to request financial eligibility calculations.\n- The MLRA system connects to the MAAT database.\n- The NoLASA system connects to the MAAT database.\n- The InfoX system saves Magistrates court updates to the MAAT database.\n- CCR calls to MAAT via LAA Hub jobs to load defendant data\n- CCLF calls to MAAT via LAA Hub jobs to load defendant data\n- CWA writes to MAAT via LAA Hub jobs to send provider details\n- Xhibit writes to MAAT via LAA Hub jobs to send Crown Court updates\n- Eforms writes to MAAT via LAA Hub jobs to submit criminal legal aid applications\n- MAAT API calls the MAAT database to update court case and means assessment data\n\n","67":" Where is MAAT hosted?\nMAAT is hosted in the LAA Landing Zone, which uses the AWS London region.\n\n","68":" Who looks after MAAT?\nMAAT is maintained by the Crime Core team in LAA Digital.\n\n","69":" What type of software is MAAT?\nMAAT is a caseworking system that is used to process criminal legal aid applications. MAAT is a Java application that uses Tomee. It runs on Java 8. The MAAT database is an Oracle Database running in AWS RDS. The MAAT database also has significant amounts of business logic contained in PL/SQL.\n\n","70":" Who are the users of MAAT?\nMAAT is used by LAA caseworkers to process applications for criminal legal aid\n\n\n","71":" How old is MAAT?\nMAAT was created in around 2008.\n\n","72":" What is the future of MAAT?\nMAAT is a 'legacy' application that is undergoing a modernisation programme. In order to safely implement upcoming changes to legal aid policy, the Crime Modernisation team decided to remove core capabilities from MAAT and 'lift and shift' them into new micro-services that will be easier and safer to implement changes in. The first of these capabilities is the 'Crime Means Assessment' service, which is now built and live - this means that MAAT no longer performs means calculations itself, but instead calls out to the new service. More functional capabilities are being pulled out of MAAT and into new services. At first, these new capabilities will use the MAAT database to persist data (this is because many downstream processes still rely on the data existing in the MAAT database). A future phase of the modernisation process will be to move this data out of the MAAT database and ensure that all relevant integrations are updated. Eventually, the MAAT UI might also be replaced by the new Crime Review service, and LAA digital might be in a position to sunset or decommission MAAT.\n","73":" What is MLRA?\nMLRA is a software system used by LAA caseworkers to interact with the Libra system and to manage representation orders for criminal legal aid. MLRA stands for Managed Libra Records Application.\n\n","74":" What relationships does MLRA have to other software systems?\n- MLRA connects to the MAAT database.\n- MLRA calls to InfoX to search for court data and to send legal aid status updates to Libra\n\n","75":" Where is MLRA hosted?\nMLRA is hosted in the LAA Landing Zone, which uses the AWS London region.\n\n","76":" Who looks after MLRA?\nMLRA is maintained by the Crime Core team in LAA Digital.\n\n","77":" What type of software is MLRA?\nMLRA is a tool that supports caseworkers when processing criminal legal aid applications. MLRA is used to communicate between the MAAT application and the magistrate court system (LIBRA via INFOX). MLRA also manages the handling of representation orders for criminal legal aid. MLRA is a Java application that uses Tomee. It runs on Java 8. MLRA connects to the MAAT database, which is an Oracle Database running in AWS RDS.\n\n","78":" Who are the users of MLRA?\nMLRA is used by criminal legal aid caseworkers as a web service.\n\n","79":" How old is MLRA?\nMLRA was created in around 2014.\n\n","80":" What is the future of MLRA?\nMLRA is considered to be a legacy software application. The capabilities of MLRA might one day be replaced as part of the MAAT modernisations programme.\n","81":" What is NoLASA?\nNoLASA is a software system used to auto-search the Libra system for court case data.\n\n","82":" What is the background context for NoLASA?\nThe Managed Libra records application (MLRA) is an LAA system that shares a database with the means assessment administration tool (MAAT). It links cases to their corresponding cases in the HMCTS Libra system. This is for the purposes of tracking cases through the course / Legal Aid system in a joined up way (i.e. updates of a person's status through the courts system is updated in LAA systems once a case is linked).\n\nIf an LAA caseworker searches for a case on the Libra system using MLRA and they are unable to find a corresponding case (this can happen for numerous reasons, for instance a Legal Aid application being submitted by a legal provider before the police/courts have added onto LIBRA), the case is marked by a caseworker as 'NOT ON LIBRA' and places onto a backlog queue (the 'not on libra' queue). Case workers will then research these cases at a later date to see if the corresponding case is now on Libra system.\n\nThis researching can take time as there is not a great way of prioritizing cases that may be on Libra. This is where the Nolasa application comes in.\n\n","83":" How does NoLASA work?\nNot On Libra Auto-Search Application (NOLASA) is a micro-service that reads cases that have been marked as 'not-on-libra' from the MLRA database once a day (8pm). It then auto-searches the HMCTS Libra system via the LAA's Infox message broker service. The message protocol used is SOAP.\n\nIf NOLASA finds that there are results returned for a case it updates its status in MLRA to say 'RESULTS FOUND'. This means that caseworkers can filter 'not on libra' cases to ones that they know they will have results for. They can then prioritize their case searching and linking more effectively.\n\n","84":" What relationships does NoLASA have to other software systems?\n- NoLASA connects to the MAAT database.\n- NoLASA calls to InfoX to perform searches of Libra\n\n","85":" Where is NoLASA hosted?\nNoLASA is hosted in the LAA Landing Zone, which uses the AWS London region.\n\n","86":" Who looks after NoLASA?\nNoLASA is maintained by the Crime Core team in LAA Digital.\n\n","87":" What type of software is NoLASA?\nThe NOSALA micro-service has been developed using Springboot framework with enbedded Tomcat server. Tomcat is fully contained in the fat JAR file. Gradle packages executable JAR file which is deployed as Docker image on AWS ECS.\n\n","88":" How old is NoLASA?\nThe first code commit for NOSALA was pushed on 8th August 2017. The history of the project before that is unknown.\n\n","89":" What is the future of NoLASA?\nHMCTS are replacing the Libra system with a new service called Common Platform. Once the replacement is complete, the Legal Aid Agency will no longer need to communicate with the Libra system and NOSALA can be decommissioned. It is highly likely that NOSALA will be needed until this time since there are no plans to build an alternative auto-search for Libra.\n","90":" What is Xhibit?\nXhibit is a case management system for crown court cases.\n\n","91":" What relationships does Xhibit have to LAA digital systems?\n- MAAT calls to Xhibit via LAA Hub to send updates on the status of criminal legal aid applications.\n- Xhibit calls to MAAT database via LAA Hub to send court case updates.\n\n","92":" Who looks after Xhibit?\nXhibit is run and maintained by HMCTS.\n\n","93":" What is the future of Xhibit?\nHMCTS are replacing the Xhibit system with a new service called Common Platform.\n"}
