As such, LAA Digital domains tend to be complex, making DDD a useful approach.\n\n","148":" What can LAA Digital teams do to manage complexity?\nOn a day to day basis, teams should think about:\n- Onboarding (because there is a large on-ramp and lots to learn in order to be effective)\n- Knowledge capture (documentation, automated tests, training materials etc)\n- Retention and wellbeing\n- The principles of domain-driven design\n\nTeams should treat these things as first-class priorities and expect to spend more time on them than normal, even if it means slowing down on other priorities in the short-term.\n\nIn terms of planning and strategy:\n- When building new services, think beyond the horizons of the initial MVP - which components of older systems might we be able to turn off, how might the transition be handled\n- When prioritising, see decommissioning as a high-value achievement in its own right and a cause for celebration.\n- Look for opportunities to buy instead of build (to limit the code we own) but avoiding the Fake COTS trap (buying but then needing to heavily customise)\n- Look for opportunities to reuse software where possible (to limit the code we own) but favouring duplication over reuse if it makes things easier to manage\n- If integrating or working with legacy systems, bear in mind that they often weren’t designed for iterative change cycles, so the pace of change is slowed\n","149":" What is DSCC?\nDSCC, also known as the Defence Solicitor Contact Centre, is the means by which the Legal Aid Agency ensures free legal advice is made accessible to a detainee in the police station.\n\nCurrently if you are arrested and would like legal advice, a custody officer will call the DSCC and they will assign your case to either your own solicitor or a local on call duty solicitor.\n\nThe DSCC will then contact the solicitor and arrange for them to attend to the detainee, either at the police station or remotely.\n\nA Duty Solicitor rota contains information about which solicitors provide this service in different regions of the UK.\n\nGet Legal Advice in Custody (GLAC) is a project in the LAA looking at how the defence solicitor service is delivered.\n\n","150":" Who looks after DSCC?\nCurrently this service is run entirely by a 3rd party, HGS.\n\n","151":" Who are the users for DSCC?\n- Custody officers call the DSCC to arrange legal advice for people in custody\n- DSCC contact centre operators use the DSCC systems to manage requests for legal advice\n\n","152":" What type of software is DSCC?\nDSCC software is built using Oracle APEX and uses Oracle database to store data.\n","153":" What is EForms?\nEForms is a set of web forms used to apply for criminal legal aid. EForms is also used to submit certain types of billing claims against criminal legal aid applications - including claims for non-standard magistrates fees, claims for prior authority costs, requests to increase the upper limit for advice on appeal, and claims for payment on account.\n\n","154":" What relationships does EForms have to LAA digital systems?\n- eForms writes to MAAT via LAA Hub jobs to submit criminal legal aid applications\n- eForms calls to LAA Portal to authenticate users\n- eForms calls to the Benefit Checker to check the benefits entitlement status of applicants\n- MAAT writes to EForms via LAA Hub jobs to send legal aid decisions and status updates.\n- CWA writes to eForms via LAA Hub jobs to send data about legal aid providers.\n\n","155":" Who looks after EForms?\nEForms is run and maintained by Equiniti. LAA have a contract with Equiniti for the use of EForms for legal aid purposes.\n\n","156":" How old is EForms?\nEForms was first created in early 2010s. It became mandatory for criminal legal aid applications in 2016.\n\n","157":" Who are the users of EForms?\n- EForms is used by legal aid providers to submit applications for criminal legal aid and to submit certain types of billing claim for criminal legal aid.\n- EForms is used by legal aid caseworkers to review applications for criminal legal aid and to review certain types of billing claim for criminal legal aid.\n","158":" What is FALA?\nFALA, also known as Find a Legal Advisor, is a web service used to search for a legal adviser or family mediator with a legal aid contract in England and Wales.\n\n","159":" Who looks after FALA?\nFALA is maintained by the CLA team in LAA Digital.\n\n","160":" Who are the users for FALA?\n- Citizens use FALA to search for legal providers\n- Legal providers and other legal professionals use FALA to search for legal providers on behalf of their clients\n\n","161":" What type of software is FALA?\nFALA is a Django application. LAALAA, which stands for Legal Aid Agency Legal Adviser API, is a JSON API for looking up legal advisers, backed by a Postgres database.\n\n","162":" Where is FALA hosted?\nFALA is hosted in the MOJ Cloud Platform, which uses the AWS London region.\n\n","163":" How old is FALA?\nFALA began development in 2015.\n","164":" Where are LAA digital software systems hosted?\nLAA digital software systems are hosted in one of four places:\n- LAA Landing Zone\n- Cloud platform\n- Modernisation Platform\n- 6 Degrees\n\n","165":" What is the LAA Landing Zone?\nThe LAA Landing Zone hosts LAA software systems in the the AWS London region. The LAA Landing Zone was created as a space to 'lift and shift' older systems that were previously running in on-premises hosting into AWS cloud. It was designed to simplify the initial migration of these systems but with the intention that those systems would then be moved into other AWS platforms with better standards and guardrails, namely Cloud Platform and Modernisation Platform. Systems that run on LAA Landing Zone will therefore need to be migrated into Cloud Platform or Modernisation Platform over the coming years. The LAA Landing Zone is run by the LAA Ops team.\n\n","166":" What is the Cloud Platform?\nThe Ministry of Justice’s Cloud Platform is a hosting platform for digital services built within the Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe Cloud Platform uses the Amazon EKS service.\n\nThe Cloud Platform is the default choice for hosting new software applications run by LAA digital.\n\nThe user guide at https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/ provides more information for teams that use the Cloud Platform.\n\n","167":" What is the Modernisation Platform?\nThe Ministry of Justice’s Modernisation Platform is a hosting platform for digital services built within the Ministry of Justice. It provides an alternative hosting option to the Ministry of Justice’s Cloud Platform, for software that is not suited to running in AWS EKS.\n\nThe user guide at https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/provides more information for teams that use the Modernisation Platform.\n\n","168":" What is 6 Degrees?\nLAA digital uses the term '6 Degrees' to refer to the historical hosting platform for LAA software applications. We have migrated nearly all of those software applications away from 6 Degrees and into AWS hosting - initially to the LAA Landing Zone. The EBS component of CCMS is still running in 6 Degrees hosting, however. VPNs connect 6 Degrees to the LAA Landing Zone to provide connectivity between EBS and other CCMS components.\n\n","169":" Where should new LAA Digital services be hosted?\nNew services should be hosted in the MOJ Cloud Platform. If teams feel that the service cannot be appropriately run on Kubernetes in Amazon EKS then teams can consider using MOJ Modernisation Platform instead.\n\n","170":" How can services in different MOJ platforms communicate with each other?\nhe MOJ Transit Gateway provides connectivity between Cloud Platform, Modernisation Platform, and the LAA Landing Zone. Services can also communicate over the internet via API endpoints. \n","171":" What is the HMRC Assurance tool?\nHMRC Assurance tool, also known as Assure HMRC Data, is a tool for the Assurance team in LAA to check the accuracy of legal aid processing by verifying the income data of applicants.\n\n","172":" What relationships does HMRC Assurance tool have to LAA digital systems?\n- HMRC Assurance Tool calls to the HMRC Interface to check the income data of applicants\n- HMRC Assurance Tool  calls to MOJ AzureAd to authenticate users\n\n","173":" Who looks after the HMRC Assurance Tool?\nHMRC Assurance Tool is being developed and maintained by the Civil Apply team in LAA Digital.\n\n","174":" What type of software is the HMRC Assurance Tool?\nThe HMRC Assurance Tool is built using Ruby on Rails.

It retrieves data from HMRC based on pre-defined use cases agreed between LAA and HMRC - income, debt and fraud data. It makes multiple calls to HMRC APIs to retrieve the relevant data for an individual. It is backed by a Postgres database. It is being developed in line with the UK digital service standard.\n\n","183":" Where is the HMRC Interface hosted?\nThe HMRC Interface is hosted in the MOJ Cloud Platform, which uses the AWS London region.\n\n","184":" How old is the HMRC Interface?\nThe HMRC Interface was released in 2022 as part of the Civil Apply project.\n\n","185":" Who are the users of the HMRC Interface?\nThe HMRC Interface is only called by other software services.\n\n","186":" Where is the code for the HMRC Interface?\nThe code for the HMRC Interface is on Github at https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa-hmrc-interface-service-api.\n","187":" What is the LAA Hub?\nThe LAA Hub is a centralised system used in LAA Digital to move information across legacy systems. The LAA Hub runs scheduled jobs that copy data between databases, running as a batch scheduling/ETL coordinator for the LAA.\n\n","188":" Who are the users for the LAA Hub?\nThe LAA Hub is only used to facilitate data transfer between LAA systems\n\n","189":" What type of software is the LAA Hub?\nThe HUB is written in PL/SQL and hosted in an Oracle database, currently in AWS RDS.\n\nScheduling of jobs normally relies on the Oracle DBMS Scheduler, but some jobs are triggered as child sub-processes instead or at the completion of a given job.\n\n","190":" What is the future of the LAA Hub?\nLAA Digital has stopped creating new Hub jobs. Instead, new services use modern interfaces, such as RESTful APIs, as a way of requesting data at the point of need. Gradually, as legacy services are replaced, so are the Hub jobs that served them, reducing the LAA's dependency on the LAA Hub. In this way, ultimately the LAA Hub will be replaced.\n","191":" What is InfoX?\nInfoX is a software system used to connect legal aid systems with a court system called Libra.\n\n","192":" What relationships does InfoX have to other software systems?\n- InfoX calls to Libra to search court case information and send updates on the status of criminal legal aid applications.\n- Libra calls to InfoX to send court case hearing updates.\n- Infox uses a SOAP Gateway to connect with Libra.\n- InfoX is an adaptor and does not persist the data it receives. Instead it writes court case updates to the MAAT database.\n- The MLRA system calls to InfoX to search for court case data.\n- The NoLASA system calls to InfoX to check for court case updates.\n\n","193":" Where is InfoX hosted?\nInfoX is hosted in the LAA Landing Zone, which uses the AWS London region.\n\n","194":" Who looks after InfoX?\nInfoX is maintained by the Crime Core team in LAA Digital.\n\n","195":" What type of software is InfoX?\nInfoX is an adaptor to the Libra system run by HMCTS. It is a Java application and uses Tomee and the SpringMVC framework. It runs on Java 8. It is not regularly updated.\n\n","196":" How old is InfoX?\nThe first code commit for InfoX was pushed on 19th May 2017. The history of the project before that is unknown.\n\n","197":" What is the future of InfoX?\nHMCTS are replacing the Libra system with a new service called Common Platform. Once the replacement is complete, the Legal Aid Agency will no longer need to communicate with the Libra system and InfoX can be decommissioned. It is highly likely that InfoX will be needed until this time since there are no plans to build an alternative adaptor to Libra.\n","198":" What programming languages are used by LAA digital teams?\nWhilst encouraging alignment, LAA digital prefers to give teams the autonomy to make the software choices that best fit their context rather than mandating a technology stack. That said, LAA digital does favour open-source over closed-source software.\n\nWhen developing new software, LAA digital teams tend to use either Ruby on Rails, Python or Java.\n\nLAA digital also has legacy systems with large amounts of PL/SQL code.\n\n","199":" What technical standards do LAA digital teams use?\nLAA digital teams follow:\n- The UK digital service standard when building new services (https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard)\n- UK government standards when designing APIs (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards)\n- UK government accessibility standards (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps)\n- Ministry of Justice cyber security guidance (https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/#cyber-and-technical-security-guidance)\n- Ministry of Justice architecture principles (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XBTuCw0y--4fZpHcTLWilSFx_qz3aewTiWYJGTZU4sA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n","200":" What tooling do LAA digital software teams use?\nLAA digital teams have autonomy to choose the tooling that best fits their context. Alignment of tooling can help with sharing of best practice, onboarding time, troubleshooting. Tools that are commonly used by LAA digital teams include:\n- Snyk: vulnerability scanning\n- Sentry: error monitoring\n- SonarCloud: code analysis\n- Prometheus: metrics monitoring\n- Kibana / ELK: log viewing\n- AlertManager: handling alerts\n- Geckoboard: dashboarding\n- Tuple: pair programming\n\n","201":" How many software systems does LAA digital have?\nLAA digital is responsible for around 90 software systems; the exact number depends on how you define a software system. The number of systems has increased year on year as LAA digital teams:\n- a) uncover 'shadow' or 'unsupported' systems that are still needed but are not managed or owned by any team\n- b) replace large monolithic software with micro-services\n- c) struggle to decommission older systems\n\n","202":" Why does LAA digital have so many software systems?\nLAA digital has steadily accumulated software over the past 25 years. Some possible reasons for this are:\n- a) The natural tendency for organisations to accumulate software as more of their processes are digitised\n- b) The variousness of legal aid. There isn’t a single legal aid journey, there are a number of fundamentally different ones (civil, criminal, legal advice, representation in court). Each one represents a different process with its own language, rules and context for users. Generally speaking, we have found that an entirely different set of services are needed for each legal aid journey type.\n- c) The complexity of legal aid. From a software perspective, we find lots of business logic that is unique to legal aid. This impacts the size of our technical estate because our services tend to require lots of different component capabilities, which are - often appropriately - run as separate software applications.\n- d) The [challenges of legacy displacement](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-legacy-displacement/) and the need to 'dual run' new micro-services with older monolithic systems until they are fully replaced\n- e) The need for 'transitional architecture' as we modernise and replace our legacy systems, such as additional APIs and adaptors for integrating new services with those systems\n\n","203":" What kind of software does LAA digital have?\nLAA digital has software that supports over a million legal aid applications and over £2 billion in legal aid payments every year, giving those who need it access to justice.\n\nLAA digital has a range of software types including:\n- online application forms\n- eligibility calculators\n- caseworking systems\n- payment systems\n\nThe nature and condition of these systems varies. One significant factor is whether the system was built before or after LAA digital was created in 2016:\n\n- From around 2000 to 2016, the LAA built systems and digitised a whole raft of paper-based processes using Oracle  products like EBS, Oracle Database, and APEX. As a result, Oracle now powers most of the LAA digital’s biggest systems - CCMS, CWA, CCR, CCLF, MAAT, MLRA, OAS, ERIC, CIS, PIMS, TV, IFS, etc. Legal aid wouldn’t happen without these systems and the teams that look after them -  together they support over a million legal aid applications and over £2 billion in payments every year, giving people who need it access to justice. However, these systems are also problematic: they are fragile and hard to change, and the knowledge they require is increasingly difficult to find and retain. With significant changes to legal aid policy on the horizon (such as the Means Test Review, CLAIR, etc), the struggle to keep these systems operational isn’t getting any easier.\n\n- LAA digital was formed in 2016 as part of a GDS-led movement to bring modern digital approaches into government. LAA digital created a number of autonomous cross-functional product teams to build new services in line with the UK digital service standard. LAA digital shifted towards favouring open source technologies, in particular Ruby, Python and Java.\n\n","204":" What is the future of LAA digital systems?\n- LAA digital is working to reduce dependency on systems that meet the government definition of 'legacy' https://www.gov.uk/guidance/managing-legacy-technology.\n- The process of legacy transformation will likely continue through a mix of 'replacement' and 'modernisation' of LAA digital's older systems.\n- LAA digital has favoured an iterative approach to replacement - picking off capabilities from legacy systems one-by-one rather than replacing whole systems as a big bang. This method has the advantage of enabling teams to release value quicker and get users into the feedback loop as early as possible. It does however mean lots of ‘dual running’.\n- LAA digital has entered a ‘transitional state’, during which its technical estate will grow before it can be streamlined back down. This is because LAA digital's biggest legacy systems were not designed in a way that allows specific components to be isolated and turned off as new services come along.\n- During this period, many legacy systems will continue to be critical to the functioning of legal aid and will need to be appropriately modernised so that they remain operational, secure, and updated in line with legal aid policy changes. This modernisation process will continue to be challenging.\n- LAA digital is designing more resilient and adaptable systems in order to help achieve the goal of creating 'simplified and more reliable access to legal aid services'. LAA Digital teams are also working to make sure that systems surface the right data to help drive decisions around simplification and automation.\n\n","205":" How many applications for legal aid are there every year?\nIn total there are around 1 million applications for legal aid in the UK each year.

In order to safely implement upcoming changes to legal aid policy, the Crime Modernisation team decided to remove core capabilities from MAAT and 'lift and shift' them into new micro-services that will be easier and safer to implement changes in. The first of these capabilities is the 'Crime Means Assessment' service, which is now built and live - this means that MAAT no longer performs means calculations itself, but instead calls out to the new service. More functional capabilities are being pulled out of MAAT and into new services. At first, these new capabilities will use the MAAT database to persist data (this is because many downstream processes still rely on the data existing in the MAAT database). A future phase of the modernisation process will be to move this data out of the MAAT database and ensure that all relevant integrations are updated. Eventually, the MAAT UI might also be replaced by the new Crime Review service, and LAA digital might be in a position to sunset or decommission MAAT.\n","245":" What is MLRA?\nMLRA is a software system used by LAA caseworkers to interact with the Libra system and to manage representation orders for criminal legal aid.

MLRA is a Java application that uses Tomee. It runs on Java 8. MLRA connects to the MAAT database, which is an Oracle Database running in AWS RDS.\n\n","250":" Who are the users of MLRA?\nMLRA is used by criminal legal aid caseworkers as a web service.\n\n","251":" How old is MLRA?\nMLRA was created in around 2014.\n\n","252":" What is the future of MLRA?\nMLRA is considered to be a legacy software application. The capabilities of MLRA might one day be replaced as part of the MAAT modernisations programme.\n","253":" What is NoLASA?\nNoLASA is a software system used to auto-search the Libra system for court case data.\n\n","254":" What is the background context for NoLASA?\nThe Managed Libra records application (MLRA) is an LAA system that shares a database with the means assessment administration tool (MAAT). It links cases to their corresponding cases in the HMCTS Libra system. This is for the purposes of tracking cases through the course / Legal Aid system in a joined up way (i.e. updates of a person's status through the courts system is updated in LAA systems once a case is linked).\n\nIf an LAA caseworker searches for a case on the Libra system using MLRA and they are unable to find a corresponding case (this can happen for numerous reasons, for instance a Legal Aid application being submitted by a legal provider before the police/courts have added onto LIBRA), the case is marked by a caseworker as 'NOT ON LIBRA' and places onto a backlog queue (the 'not on libra' queue). Case workers will then research these cases at a later date to see if the corresponding case is now on Libra system.\n\nThis researching can take time as there is not a great way of prioritizing cases that may be on Libra. This is where the Nolasa application comes in.\n\n","255":" How does NoLASA work?\nNot On Libra Auto-Search Application (NOLASA) is a micro-service that reads cases that have been marked as 'not-on-libra' from the MLRA database once a day (8pm). It then auto-searches the HMCTS Libra system via the LAA's Infox message broker service. The message protocol used is SOAP.\n\nIf NOLASA finds that there are results returned for a case it updates its status in MLRA to say 'RESULTS FOUND'. This means that caseworkers can filter 'not on libra' cases to ones that they know they will have results for. They can then prioritize their case searching and linking more effectively.\n\n","256":" What relationships does NoLASA have to other software systems?\n- NoLASA connects to the MAAT database.\n- NoLASA calls to InfoX to perform searches of Libra\n\n","257":" Where is NoLASA hosted?\nNoLASA is hosted in the LAA Landing Zone, which uses the AWS London region.\n\n","258":" Who looks after NoLASA?\nNoLASA is maintained by the Crime Core team in LAA Digital.\n\n","259":" What type of software is NoLASA?\nThe NOSALA micro-service has been developed using Springboot framework with enbedded Tomcat server. Tomcat is fully contained in the fat JAR file. Gradle packages executable JAR file which is deployed as Docker image on AWS ECS.\n\n","260":" How old is NoLASA?\nThe first code commit for NOSALA was pushed on 8th August 2017. The history of the project before that is unknown.\n\n","261":" What is the future of NoLASA?\nHMCTS are replacing the Libra system with a new service called Common Platform. Once the replacement is complete, the Legal Aid Agency will no longer need to communicate with the Libra system and NOSALA can be decommissioned. It is highly likely that NOSALA will be needed until this time since there are no plans to build an alternative auto-search for Libra.\n","262":" What security guidance should LAA Digital teams use?\nLAA Digital teams should:\n- Follow the Ministry of Justice cyber security guidance - https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/#cyber-and-technical-security-guidance\n- Be aware of the OWASP list of common vulnerabilities when developing applications - https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/\n- If unsure, refer to the MoJ Cyber Security team (who can be messaged in the #security Slack channel)\n\n","263":" What should LAA Digital teams do if they have a security related incident?\n\nTeams should assess the impact of any breach and take any immediate action to secure their applications and data.\n\nSecurity incidents will happen, teams should not worry about informing others and flagging suspected breaches. You should inform:\n- The LAA Technical Architects\n- The MoJ Cyber Security team (via the #security Slack channel)\n- Any other teams who have services that might be effected\n- If appropriate, the LAA Digital SMT and other stakeholders\n\nOnce the incident is resolved, it is important to learn the lessons of the breach and put in place any appropriate mitigations and controls. A retrospective or postmortem should be held to help facilitate this.\n\n","264":" What security testing should LAA Digital teams do before releasing new software services?\nIt is normal for LAA Digital teams to carry out an ITHC before releasing new services to private or public beta. It is also recommended to hold a threat vulnerability modelling session (TVM) prior to the ITHC, which can help to form the scope for the ITHC testing. The MoJ Cyber Security team can help to facilitate TVM sessions with teams.\n\nLAA Digital teams also use security tooling as standard:\n- Snyk for vulnerability scanning\n- SonarCloud for code analysis\n- Sentry for error monitoring\n- ModSec as a web application firewall (this can be configured for services running on MoJ Cloud Platform https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/networking/modsecurity.html)\n\nFor other security tooling and testing techniques, please refer to the LAA Developer (Slack #laa-developers) and Cyber Security (Slack #security) communities.\n","265":" What is VCD?\nVCD is a web service that Application and Billing caseworkers use to interact with data in the courts.\n\n","266":" Who looks after VCD?\nVCD is maintained by the Assess a Claim team in LAA Digital.\n\n","267":" Who are the users for VCD?\n- Billing caseworkers use VCD to verify court details when assessing billing claims\n- Criminal application caseworkers use VCD to verify court details when assessing applications for criminal legal aid\n\n","268":" What relationships does VCD have with LAA Digital systems?\n- View Court Data calls to Court Data Adaptor to retrieve court case data.\n\n","269":" What type of software is VCD?\nVCD is a Ruby on Rails application that provides a frontend to data in CDA and stores certain data in a Postgres database.\n\n","270":" Where is VCD hosted?\nVCD is hosted in the Cloud Platform, which uses the AWS London region.\n","271":" What is Xhibit?\nXhibit is a case management system for crown court cases.\n\n","272":" What relationships does Xhibit have to LAA digital systems?\n- MAAT calls to Xhibit via LAA Hub to send updates on the status of criminal legal aid applications.\n- Xhibit calls to MAAT database via LAA Hub to send court case updates.\n\n","273":" Who looks after Xhibit?\nXhibit is run and maintained by HMCTS.\n\n","274":" What is the future of Xhibit?\nHMCTS are replacing the Xhibit system with a new service called Common Platform.\n"}
